This is a simple Python text formatting project. After searching for this capability for a little while, I decided to write my own as the following requirements seemed to be unique:

Create a table of numbers from a CSV file
Control the number of significant figures (significant digits) displayed
Format numbers with “,” and ” ” like this 123,456.789 123
Align columns on decimal points–this is best for readability
Fit the columns automatically based on data and formatting
There are many code snippets that do one part or another of this, but I didn’t find anything that fulfilled all the requirements. So I created couple of simple classes to accomplish the task. One caveat is that the output needs to be displayed in a constant-space font.

Example output:

  483,000. |       471.7 |     0.460 6 | 0.000 449 8
  966,000. |       943.4 |     0.921 3 | 0.000 899 7
1,449,000. |     1,415.  |     1.382   | 0.001 349  
1,932,000. |     1,887.  |     1.843   | 0.001 799  
2,415,000. |     2,358.  |     2.303   | 0.002 249  
2,898,000. |     2,830.  |     2.764   | 0.002 699  
3,381,000. |     3,302.  |     3.224   | 0.003 149  
3,864,000. |     3,773.  |     3.685   | 0.003 599  
5,796,000. |     5,660.  |     5.528   | 0.005 398  
7,728,000. |     7,547.  |     7.370   | 0.007 197  
9,660,000. |     9,434.  |     9.213   | 0.008 997

  
Handles negative numbers correctly too. Enjoy!
